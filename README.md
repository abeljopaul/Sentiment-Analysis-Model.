# Sentiment Analysis Model

## Project Overview
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of analyzing textual data to determine the sentiment behind it. This project aims to build a sentiment analysis model that classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The model leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to provide accurate sentiment predictions.

### Objectives:
1. Preprocess and clean textual data for sentiment analysis.
2. Apply NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization.
3. Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Deep Learning models) for sentiment classification.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Demonstrate practical data science techniques such as feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

### Value of the Project:
- Helps businesses analyze customer feedback, social media posts, and product reviews.
- Enhances decision-making by providing insights into public opinion.
- Automates sentiment classification, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.

## Dataset and Data Handling
- **Dataset Name:** Sentiment Analysis Dataset
- **Source:** Publicly available datasets (e.g., IMDb, Twitter sentiment data, customer reviews)
- **Description:**
  - Contains text samples labeled with sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral).
  - May include additional metadata such as timestamps and user details.

### Data Preparation Steps:
1. Removed missing or duplicate entries.
2. Normalized text by converting it to lowercase and removing special characters.
3. Applied NLP techniques like tokenization and stemming.

---

## Data Preprocessing
- Tokenization was applied to split text into words.
- Stopwords were removed to focus on meaningful words.
- Stemming and lemmatization were used to reduce words to their root forms.
- Vectorization techniques like TF-IDF and Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) were used to convert text into numerical form.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Key Analyses:
1. Word frequency distribution to identify common words in positive and negative texts.
2. Sentiment distribution to check class imbalance.
3. Visualization of sentiment trends over time.

### Visualizations:
- Word clouds for positive and negative sentiments.
- Sentiment class distribution histograms.
- Time-series analysis of sentiment trends.

---

## Feature Engineering
### Techniques Applied:
1. **TF-IDF Vectorization:** To represent text numerically.
2. **Word Embeddings:** Used pre-trained embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) for better context understanding.
3. **N-grams:** Captured phrase-level patterns for improved sentiment detection.

---

## Model Training
### Models Used:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for deep learning-based analysis

#### Training Steps:
1. Split data into training and testing sets.
2. Train multiple models and optimize hyperparameters.
3. Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

---

## Model Evaluation
### Performance Metrics:
- **Accuracy:** Measures overall correctness of predictions.
- **Precision & Recall:** Evaluates the trade-off between false positives and false negatives.
- **F1-score:** Provides a balanced measure of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualizes correct and incorrect predictions.

---

## Assumptions and Limitations
### Assumptions:
1. The dataset is assumed to be representative of real-world sentiment trends.
2. Preprocessing steps like stopword removal improve model accuracy.
3. Sentiment labels in the dataset are correctly annotated.

### Limitations:
1. **Context Understanding:** Models may misinterpret sarcasm and idioms.
2. **Bias in Data:** Dataset may contain biases that affect predictions.
3. **Domain-Specific Performance:** A model trained on movie reviews may not generalize well to product reviews or social media posts.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Running the Model:
```bash
